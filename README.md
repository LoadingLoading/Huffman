# Huffman
There are three .py files, which are individualy solving different problem. The original one is copy from this website: https://www.jianshu.com/p/caf0e5d4dbcd

It provides an implementation of Huffman coding for the alphabets based on their frequency.

The Huffman.py changed the code based on the original version. You can choose different D-ary for Huffman coding. It will provide dummy letters automatically.

The ACTG.py changed the code based on the Huffman.py. It will read the sequence file, calculate the frequence and use 2-ary, 3-ary and 4-ary to code the file and produce new file for each one.
